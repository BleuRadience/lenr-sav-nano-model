# LENR SAV Nano Model: Coulomb Barrier Suppression in Pd₃VacD₄

**Author**: BleuRadience (Independent Researcher)  
**Date**: December 27, 2025  

## Overview
This repository contains a theoretical analysis of low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) via Coulomb barrier suppression in superabundant vacancy (SAV) phases of palladium-deuterium systems, extended with resonance dynamics and nanoparticle catalysis. Developed through AI-assisted iterative inquiry and clinical trial-inspired methodology for reproducibility.

Key findings: Electron density enhancements (α ≥ 3, nano-boosted to ~30) eliminate the barrier at 2.75 Å D-D separation, predicting ~2.4 W/cm³ power density.
